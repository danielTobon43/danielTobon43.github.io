 Mechatronics Engineer professionally since April 2019 with an emphasis on Application Development in Computer Vision and embedded systems. I was a member of the student research group in robotics <a href="https://semilleroderobotica.wixsite.com/semillero-iruao-eng" target="_blank">SIR</a>. I played a key role as a Researcher in Electronics at <a href="https://www.technologygateway.ie/network/imar-gateway/" target="_blank">IMaR Technology Gateway</a>: The Intelligent Mechatronics and RFID Research Centre based at IT Tralee in Kerry, Ireland. I am passionate about Computer Vision and Intelligent robotics perception systems, image processing, 3D reconstruction, deep learning and AI.<br><br><br>

 In the future, I would like to work in 3D mapping and computer vision projects, Machine Learning, image and point cloud processing. <br><br>

 I am a person with a specific interest in a role of Computer Vision Engineer, and Research Engineer.
