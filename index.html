 Mechatronics Engineer professionally since April 2019 with an emphasis on Application Development in Robotics Perception Systems, Computer Vision techniques (Object Detection and Recognition, Segmentation, Pattern Recognition, 3D graphics, 3D geometry, Camera Calibration), Image Processing, Depth Processing (LiDAR, Stereo Cameras, Structure From Motion), Robot Operating System (ROS) for path planning, CAD modelling, navigation stack, Point Cloud Library (PCL) and embedded systems. I have experience in software development, motion planning, and Intelligent systems. At the moment, I am working as a Researcher in Electronics at IMaR Technology Gateway: The Intelligent Mechatronics and RFID Research Centre based at IT Tralee in Kerry, Ireland. I am passionate about Computer Vision and Intelligent robotics perception systems, Mobile robotics, multi-robot cooperative systems, and Autonomous Vehicles. In the future, I would like to work in SLAM projects, Machine Learning Algorithms applied to environment understanding and for decision-making, and classification. I am a person with a specific interest in a role of Robotics Engineer, Computer Vision Engineer, and Research Engineer.
