 Mechatronics Engineer professionally since April 2019 with an emphasis on Application Development in Robotics Perception Systems, Computer Vision techniques, and embedded systems. I was a member of the student research group in robotics <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/semilleroRobotica/about/" target="_blank">SIR</a>. At the moment, I am working as a Researcher in Electronics at <a href="https://www.technologygateway.ie/network/imar-gateway/" target="_blank">IMaR Technology Gateway</a>: The Intelligent Mechatronics and RFID Research Centre based at IT Tralee in Kerry, Ireland. I am passionate about Computer Vision and Intelligent robotics perception systems, Mobile robotics, multi-robot cooperative systems, and Autonomous Vehicles.<br><br><br>

 In the future, I would like to work in SLAM and computer vision projects, Machine Learning Algorithms applied to environment understanding and for decision-making, and classification. <br><br>

 I am a person with a specific interest in a role of Robotics Engineer, Computer Vision Engineer, and Research Engineer.
