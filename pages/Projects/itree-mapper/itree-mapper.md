**Development of a robotic perception system for geometric feature estimation of an individual tree.**
This is a C++ project to build a point cloud representation of an object using a ZR300 Intel realsense camera with RGB and depth data. The program uses PCL as a framework to read data and display points. On the other hand, I tested the camera with the middleware ROS and RVIZ to compare the best framework for the project in robotics applications.
