- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): Development of a robotic perception system to estimate geometric features of an individual tree
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): Interface framework for a ZR300 Intel Realsense camera in PCL and ROS
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): Data analytics and Industrial Internet of Things project for a human-machine interface 
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): RFID project to read an animal tag using the RFIDRW-E-TTL with a nRF5 SDK 16.0
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): CMake project for the nRF52 SDK to program an nRF52832 using JLink
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): IoT application for getting the strain deformation data of a strain gauges sensor using an ESP32 micro-controller and the ESP_IDF framework
- [itree-mapper](./itree-mapper/itree-mapper.md): Gui for select image pixel reference for iTree3DMap. This program uses the control point registration GUI of OpenMVG as base.
