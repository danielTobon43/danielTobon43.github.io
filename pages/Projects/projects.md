- [<b>itree-mapper</b>](./itree-mapper/info.md): Development of a robotic perception system to estimate dendometric features of an individual tree
- [<b>dbscan-octrees</b>](./dbscan-pcl/info.md): Dbscan implementation in PCL
- [<b>zr300-wrapper</b>](./zr300-interface/info.md): Interface framework for a ZR300 Intel Realsense camera in PCL and ROS
- <b>plotly-dash-project</b>: Data science and Industrial Internet of Things project for a human-machine interface 
- [<b>RFID-wrapper</b>](./rfid-animal-tag/info.md): RFID project to read an animal tag using the RFIDRW-E-TTL with a nRF5 SDK 16.0
- [<b>nRF5-wrapper</b>](./nrf5-framework/info.md): CMake project for the nRF52 SDK to program an nRF52832 using JLink
- [<b>hx711-wrapper</b>](./hx711-interface/info.md): IoT application for getting the strain deformation data of a strain gauges sensor using an ESP32 micro-controller and the ESP_IDF framework
- [<b>sht1x-wrapper</b>](./sht1x-interface/info.md): This is a C library for the SHT1X Temperature-Humidity sensor for esp-idf framework
- [<b>gui-control-points</b>](./gui-control-points/info.md): Gui to select image pixel reference for iTree3DMap. This program uses the control point registration GUI of OpenMVG as base.
- [<b>canopy-missing</b>](./canopy-missing/info.md): C++ algorithm to estimate percent canopy missing of a stem tree using PCL 1.9.1 and OpenCV 4.1.0
- [<b>sfM-danPipeline</b>](./sfm-dan/info.md): A simple structure from motion pipeline for 3D incremental reconstruction
- <b>urdf-gazebo-sim</b>: URDF model and Gazebo simulation of a 7DOF robot using ROS. In this project, I performed the trajectory planning of a robot arm in Gazebo using the URDF, XACRO model, and the Moveit package. I created a ROS package for the project and the CAD model on SolidWorks. 
- <b>robot-arm</b>: Robotic arm design with 5 degrees of freedom. Robotic arm design for an assembly line using stress theory and deformation due to mechanical failure. I achieved a CAD model on SolidWorks with its corresponding finite element analysis. I designed the robot arm to support a 2 kg load.
- [<b>esp32-client-server</b>](./esp32-client/info.md): This is a C program for the sta and ap module of the esp32 using ESP_IDF framework
- [<b>upsampling-pointcloud</b>](./upsampling-cloud/info.md): Upsampling method for an input cloud using mls method of PCL 1.9.1
- [<b>pointcloud-to-mesh</b>](./pointcloud-mesh/info.md): C++ application to convert pcd file, ply file, txt file or xyz point cloud to MESH representation (Gp3).
- [<b>align-pointcloud</b>](./align-cloud/info.md): C++ application to align a pointcloud to the global reference frame in PCL.
- [<b>stitching</b>](./stitching/info.md): C++ application to create a panorama from multiple images in OpenCV.
- [<b>update-trace</b>](./update-trace/info.md): Python program to update multiple traces in a plotly python graph.
