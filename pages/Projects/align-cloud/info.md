<div style="text-align: justify ">
Alignment between the coordinate system of a point cloud and the global coordinate system of pcl. Using the dot product and the cross product, a normal plane vector is extracted from the point cloud using the NormalEstimation Method. Then, a normal plane XYZ vector (x = 0, y = 0, z = 1). Finally, a rotation matrix is obtained from a rotation vector (axis of rotation) and an angle of rotation.<br><br>
