This is a library to update multiples traces in a dcc.Graph using dash plotly in python. This code is based from the "mydcc.Change_trace", repo: https://github.com/jimmybow/mydcc. The idea is to update a trace or a list of traces in a callback without the need of re-draw the figure (you don't need a layout property)..<br><br>
