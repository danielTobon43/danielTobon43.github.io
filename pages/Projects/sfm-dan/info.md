<div style="text-align: justify ">
This is a reference implementation of a Structure-from-Motion pipeline in OpenCV, following the work of Roy Shilkrot at SfM-Toy-Library. https://github.com/royshil/SfM-Toy-Library<br><br>

Note: This is not a complete and robust SfM pipeline implementation. The purpose of this code is to do a 3D reconstruction of a tree and get dendrometry estimation. <br><br>
